# Pong_game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game for two players, built using Python's Turtle module.

## Features
- Two-player mode (Player A and Player B)
- Simple controls for each player
- Score tracking for both players
- Classic Pong mechanics with ball bouncing off paddles and walls

## Controls
Player A (Left Paddle):

Move Up: W
Move Down: S

Player B (Right Paddle):

Move Up: Up Arrow
Move Down: Down Arrow

## How to Play
The game starts automatically once you run the script.
Players use their controls to move the paddles up and down to hit the ball.
The first player to miss the ball allows the opponent to score a point.
The game continues until you close the window.
